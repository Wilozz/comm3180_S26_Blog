    "Outdoor bouldering is a niche and intense form of outdoor climbing on natural rock formations. Bouldering is one type of rock climbing classified by its short but tricky climbs done without any safety harnesses. A more well known form of this activity may be lead climbing or free soloing where climbers scale massive cliff faces thousands of feet tall. A famous climber who recently appeared in the headlines is Alex Honnold who recently climbed the 11th tallest building in the world, Taipei 101, without any safety equipment live on Netflix. He is also the only person to climb the famous mountain El Capitan without safety equipment, a cliff face 3000 feet tall."
