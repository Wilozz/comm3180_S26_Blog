    "text": "Which are the Strongest Teams in the Winter Olympics?\n\nThe winter olympics is an international competition held every four years across a number of days, events and sports, exclusively on ice and snow. Since originating in 1924, it has grown to be a major event with over 90 countries participating in it, garnering over 20 million daily viewers from the US alone and billions of total views over the days of the event. In this blog, we will be exploring the countries who have been dominating these games and has consistently proven themselves to be the best in these sports.\n\nSetup\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nLoading the Data\n\nwolympics_df = pd.read_csv('data/winter_olympics_medals.csv')\nbios = pd.read_csv('data/bios.csv')\ncountries = pd.read_csv('data/country-and-continent-codes-list.csv')\npopulations = pd.read_csv('data/populations.csv')\nworld_gdf = gpd.read_file('data/worldmap.json')\nbios = bios.dropna(subset = [\"born_country\"])\n\n\n\nWhich Countries Are the Best in the Olympics?\n\ngold_counts = (\n    wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"medal\"] == \"Gold\"]\n      .drop_duplicates(subset=[\"year\", \"type\", \"discipline\", \"event\", \"medal\", \"noc\"])\n      .groupby(\"noc\")\n      .size()\n      .reset_index(name=\"gold_count\")\n      .sort_values(\"gold_count\", ascending=False)\n)\n\n\ngold_counts.head(10).plot(\n    x = \"noc\",\n    y = \"gold_count\",\n    kind = \"bar\",\n    title = \"Top 10 countries by total gold medals\",\n    legend = False\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the fonunding of the games, these countries have topped the rankings in terms of gold medals won. Norway, Germany, USA, Austria and Canada, these five countries some of which are heavily characterised by their heavy yearly snowfall have all been founding members of the winter olympics, having competed since the first ever game in 1924.\nWinning a gold medal is a true tribute to the hard work of the athletes and is an amazing and valuable achievement celebrating the intense training, sacrifice and effort they have all put into the sport. It places them as the best athelete globally in that respect and this ranking shows the countries which have the most dominance in certain sports.\nHowever, an all rounded nature is also important to consider. Besides just the gold medal, countries can win silver and bronze medals to.\n\nmedal_counts = (\n    wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"medal\"].isin([\"Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Bronze\"])]\n      .drop_duplicates(subset=[\"year\", \"type\", \"discipline\", \"event\", \"medal\", \"noc\"])\n      .groupby(\"noc\")\n      .size()\n      .reset_index(name=\"medal_count\")\n      .sort_values(\"medal_count\", ascending=False)\n)\n\n\nmedal_counts.head(10).plot(\n    x=\"noc\",\n    y=\"medal_count\",\n    kind=\"bar\",\n    title=\"Top 10 Countries by Total Medals\",\n    legend=False\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that the top five countries remain the same although in terms of total medals earned, the USA shifts ahead of Germany. This indicates that the USA is more competitive across more sports in comparison to Germany who would be more specialised in a certain field.\nHowever, it is more valuable to analyse the results from recent years as athletes are constantly training and honing their skills to be more competitive every single year.\n\nwinner_2022 = (\n    wolympics_df[\n        (wolympics_df[\"year\"] == 2022.0) &\n        (wolympics_df[\"medal\"].isin([\"Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Bronze\"]))\n    ]\n    .drop_duplicates(subset=[\"noc\", \"event\", \"medal\"])\n    .groupby(\"noc\")\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medal_count\")\n    .sort_values(\"medal_count\", ascending=False)\n)\n\n\nwinner_2022.head(10).plot(\n    x = \"noc\",\n    y = \"medal_count\",\n    kind = \"bar\",\n    title = \"Top 10 Countries by Medals in 2022\",\n    legend = False\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at this chart, we can see that as of the last completed Winter Olympic games in 2022, Russia (ROC) has asserted their position as a strong competitor in the games.

    "text": "Which Days Were the Most Optimal For Outdoor Bouldering?\n\nOutdoor bouldering is a niche and intense form of outdoor climbing on natural rock formations. Bouldering is one type of rock climbing classified by its short but tricky climbs done without any safety harnesses. A more well known form of this activity may be lead climbing or free soloing where climbers scale massive cliff faces thousands of feet tall. A famous climber who recently appeared in the headlines is Alex Honnold who recently climbed the 11th tallest building in the world, Taipei 101, without any safety equipment live on Netflix. He is also the only person to climb the famous mountain El Capitan without safety equipment, a cliff face 3000 feet tall.\nQuestion: In the past 25 years, how many days had the most optimal conditions for climbing\nWe will define an optimal day for climbing if it satisfies the following conditions - It’s a sunny day - It’s on a weekend as that’s the time most people climb - The temperature is at a comfortable level between 64 and 75 degrees inclusive - There has not been any rain in the last 2 days and no snow within the last week to ensure the rocks have sufficient grip\n\nSetup\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nLoad the Dataset\n\nweather_df = pd.read_csv('data/philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv')\nweather_df = weather_df.assign(date=pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']))\n\n\nweather_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nday\nyear\nhigh\nlow\nrain\nsnow\ndate\nday_num\nmonth_num\ndow\ndow_name\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n0\nJanuary 1\n2005\n64\n39\n0.00\n0.0\n2005-01-01\n1\n1\n5\nSaturday\nJanuary\n\n\n1\nJanuary 2\n2005\n47\n33\n0.01\n0.0\n2005-01-02\n2\n1\n6\nSunday\nJanuary\n\n\n2\nJanuary 3\n2005\n57\n40\n0.06\n0.0\n2005-01-03\n3\n1\n0\nMonday\nJanuary\n\n\n3\nJanuary 4\n2005\n55\n44\n0.00\n0.0\n2005-01-04\n4\n1\n1\nTuesday\nJanuary\n\n\n4\nJanuary 5\n2005\n47\n36\n0.62\n0.0\n2005-01-05\n5\n1\n2\nWednesday\nJanuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunny Days\nThe most important condition for outdoor bouldering is that it must be sunny. If it’s raining or snowing, the climber will have poor visibility going up the climb and will also find it difficult to grip the rock. This will make the climb extremely dangerous.\n\nsunny_df = weather_df.query(\"rain == 0 and snow == 0\")\nsunny_df.shape[0]\n\n5130\n\n\nAs such, we can see there are 5130 days in the past 20 years where it was possible to go climbing.\n\n\nWeekends\nWe also know that most climbers are casual, recreational climbers. As such, the most suitable days for them are Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. As such, we will calculate the number of sunny weekends in the past 20 years which would’ve been the times most climbers were out.\n\nweekend_sunny_df = sunny_df.query(\"dow &gt;= 4 and dow &lt;= 6\")\nweekend_sunny_df.shape[0]\n\n2209\n\n\nHere, we can see that there were 2209 such days which were sunny.\n\n\nComfortable Temperature\nGiven the nature of outdoor bouldering, you are engaging in physical exercise outside. As such, it would be preferred if the temperature wasn’t too hot or too cold. We will define the optimal temperature to be between 64 and 75 degrees inclusive which is a tight range in which you would be able to stay outside all day comfortably.\n\ngood_temp_df = weather_df.query(\"high &lt;= 75 and low &gt;= 64\")\ngood_temp_df.shape[0]\n\n48\n\n\nWe can see that the number of days that actually fall within this range is actually quite limited. That’s because it’s very rare for the temperature to stay within that bound completely over the course of the entire day, often exceeding it at noon or dropping below it at night.\n\n\nGood Weather Conditions\nIn outdoor bouldering, it would also be preferred if there was no rain within the last 2 days and no snow within the past week. By climbing on natural rock formations, the rock must be dry when climbing or else it would be very difficult to get a good hold on small holds. As such, time must be given for any rain or snow to dry and melt.\n\nNo Rain\n\nno_rain = weather_df[\"rain\"].eq(0)\nstreak_id = (no_rain != no_rain.shift()).cumsum()\ndry_streak_day = weather_df.groupby(streak_id).cumcount() + 1\nno_rain_two_plus_df = weather_df[no_rain & (dry_streak_day &gt;= 2)].copy()\nno_rain_two_plus_df.shape[0]\n\n3704\n\n\n\n\nNo Snow\n\nno_snow = weather_df[\"snow\"].eq(0)\nsnow_streak_id = (no_snow != no_snow.shift()).cumsum()\nsnowless_streak_day = weather_df.groupby(snow_streak_id).cumcount() + 1\nno_snow_week_plus_df = weather_df[no_snow & (snowless_streak_day &gt;= 7)].copy()\nno_snow_week_plus_df.shape[0]\n\n6655\n\n\n\n\nNo Snow and No Rain\n\ngood_weather_conditions_df = no_rain_two_plus_df.merge(no_snow_week_plus_df, how = \"inner\")\ngood_weather_conditions_df.shape[0]\n\n3320\n\n\nFrom the above code chunks, we can observe that there are 3320 days with no rain in the past two days and no snow within the past week. These are the number of days where the rock is dry enough to climb.\n\n\n\nNumber of Optimal Days\nHaving found the days which satisfy all of our conditions above, we can now merge all the conditions to find the days with the most optimal climbing conditions in the past 20 years.\n\ngood_temp_weekends_df = weekend_sunny_df.merge(good_temp_df, how = \"inner\")\noptimal_days_df = good_temp_weekends_df.merge(good_weather_conditions_df, how = \"inner\")\noptimal_days_df.shape[0]\n\n1\n\n\nHere we can see that only one day in the past 20 years actually fits all of our conditions.\n\noptimal_days_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nday\nyear\nhigh\nlow\nrain\nsnow\ndate\nday_num\nmonth_num\ndow\ndow_name\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n0\nJune 11\n2022\n75\n66\n0.0\n0.0\n2022-06-11\n11\n6\n5\nSaturday\nJune\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat day is June 11th 2022, a Saturday with a high temperature of 75 degrees and a low of 66 degrees.\n\n\nSpread of Non-Rainy Days on Weekends\nNow, we know that it would be ridiculous to assume that people would only climb on days with the most optimal conditions. As such, we will simply consider the requirments that it must not be raining on the day and it must be on a weekend. A simple bar graph can illustrate the spead of days in which people can climb then.\n\ncounts = (\n    weather_df[weather_df[\"rain\"] == 0]\n    .query(\"dow_name in ['Friday','Saturday','Sunday']\")\n    [\"dow_name\"]\n    .value_counts()\n    .reindex([\"Friday\",\"Saturday\",\"Sunday\"])\n)\n\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.bar(counts.index, counts.values)\nplt.xlabel(\"Day of Week\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Non-Rainy Days\")\nplt.title(\"Spead of Non-Rainy Days on Weekends\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows us that the spread of non-rainy days on weekends is roughly the same, with a bit over 2100 days in total. As such, we can conclude that the total number of people who have climbed on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday are roughly equal."

It measures 5 aspects of the individual’s personality, namely extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. These sections are defined as such.\nExtroversion: A person’s tendency to be energised by social interaction, preferring to be more outgoing and assertive rather than solitude and reflection.\nEmotional Stability: An individual’s ability to remain calm, balanced and resilient under stress where someone with higher emotional stability would be able to manage negative emotions better.\nAgreeableness: How an individual balances their needs against others. Individuals with higher agreeableness are more cooperative, empathetic and trusting, sometimes putting others needs before their own while individuals with lower scores are more skeptical, cynical and direct.\nConscientiousness: An individual’s ability for self discipline, orginisation, achievement striving and responsibility. An individual who has a higher conscientiousness score would be able to better control their impulses.\nIntelligence/Imagination: Measures an individuals ability to engage in fantasy, aesthetic appreciation and creative, non-conventional thinking.\n\n\nScoring the Data\nTo compare personality traits across countries or even just between people, it is necessary to score the data. The big 5 personality test is constructed off 5 factors, namely extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. In the test, questions are presented to the user with some contributing positively towards the score and others reducing the overall score. For each of the 5 sections, the maxmium amount of points attainable for each section is: - Extroversion: 20 - Emotional Stability: 2 - Agreeableness: 26 - Conscientiousness: 26 - Intellect/Imagination: 32\n\nextroversion_vec = [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1]\nemotional_vec = [-1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]\nagreeableness_vec = [-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,1]\nconscientiousness_vec = [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1]\nintellect_imagination_vec = [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,1,1]\n\nbig5_df[\"Extroversion\"] = (big5_df[[f\"E{i}\" for i in range(1,11)]]\n                           .values @ extroversion_vec)\n\nbig5_df[\"Emotional_Stability\"] = (big5_df[[f\"N{i}\" for i in range(1,11)]]\n                                  .values @ emotional_vec)\n\nbig5_df[\"Agreeableness\"] = (big5_df[[f\"A{i}\" for i in range(1,11)]]\n                            .values @ agreeableness_vec)\n\nbig5_df[\"Conscientiousness\"] = (big5_df[[f\"C{i}\" for i in range(1,11)]]\n                                .values @ conscientiousness_vec)\n\nbig5_df[\"Intellect_Imagination\"] = (big5_df[[f\"O{i}\" for i in range(1,11)]]\n                                    .values @ intellect_imagination_vec)\n\n\nsubset_df = big5_df.iloc[:, list(range(0, 6)) + list(range(57, 62))]\nsubset_df.head(5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace\nage\nengnat\ngender\nhand\nsource\nExtroversion\nEmotional_Stability\nAgreeableness\nConscientiousness\nIntellect_Imagination\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n53\n1\n1\n1\n1\n14\n1\n22\n23\n25\n\n\n1\n13\n46\n1\n2\n1\n1\n-8\n-19\n11\n18\n8\n\n\n2\n1\n14\n2\n2\n1\n1\n5\n-34\n14\n25\n27\n\n\n3\n3\n19\n2\n2\n1\n1\n-8\n-31\n13\n2\n23\n\n\n4\n11\n25\n2\n2\n1\n2\n4\n-18\n20\n10\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping Scores by Region\nThe dataset in which we are utilising has already asked users to input their race as one of 14 categories. - 0: Missed - 1: Mixed Race - 2: Arctic (Siberian, Eskimo) - 3: Caucasian (European) - 4: Caucasian (Indian) - 5: Caucasian (Middle East) - 6: Caucasian (North African, Other) - 7: Indigenous Australian - 8: Native American - 9: North East Asian (Mongol, Tibetan, Korean Japanese, etc) - 10: Pacific (Polynesian, Micronesian, etc) - 11: South East Asian (Chinese, Thai, Malay, Filipino, etc) - 12: West African, Bushmen, Ethiopian - 13: Other\n\nrace_avg_scores = (\n    big5_df\n        .groupby(\"race\")[[\n            \"Extroversion\",\n            \"Emotional_Stability\",\n            \"Agreeableness\",\n            \"Conscientiousness\",\n            \"Intellect_Imagination\"\n        ]]\n        .mean()\n        .reset_index()\n)\nrace_avg_scores.head(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace\nExtroversion\nEmotional_Stability\nAgreeableness\nConscientiousness\nIntellect_Imagination\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0.274510\n-19.143791\n15.588235\n10.640523\n19.967320\n\n\n1\n1\n0.037657\n-18.895397\n14.028591\n9.013947\n21.595537\n\n\n2\n2\n5.214286\n-15.214286\n12.857143\n8.000000\n22.285714\n\n\n3\n3\n0.153839\n-18.705229\n14.537629\n9.283572\n22.280820\n\n\n4\n4\n0.191041\n-20.119236\n14.497365\n9.240448\n19.123847\n\n\n5\n5\n0.825243\n-19.763107\n14.438835\n9.768932\n19.998058\n\n\n6\n6\n0.146096\n-18.725441\n14.445844\n9.335013\n20.579345\n\n\n7\n7\n1.458333\n-18.208333\n11.083333\n6.333333\n21.000000\n\n\n8\n8\n0.223881\n-17.696517\n14.248756\n10.746269\n19.004975\n\n\n9\n9\n-0.425532\n-20.074468\n12.893617\n8.627660\n19.398936\n\n\n10\n10\n0.676923\n-17.292308\n14.215385\n8.969231\n19.876923\n\n\n11\n11\n-1.339602\n-19.972058\n13.510478\n9.607200\n19.024718\n\n\n12\n12\n0.891892\n-16.123552\n15.594595\n10.687259\n21.231660\n\n\n13\n13\n0.739914\n-18.938112\n14.936937\n10.333725\n19.209949\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtroversion by Race\nFrom the table presented above, we can observe that asians hold the lowest extroversion scores on average with North East Asians having a score of -0.43 and south east asians having a score of -1.34, the only race to have a negative extroversion score on average. Meanwhile, the race with the highest extroversion score on average are the Arctic people. This is not necessarily surprising as Asian culture places emphasis on following rules and not standing out which is why it can be observed that many asians will mind their own business and develop a more introverted personality.\n\n\nEmotional Stability\nIn terms of emotional stability, the results are pretty equal across all races. In particular, only the Arctic people and the West Africans, Bushman and Ethiopians stand out with the highest emotional stability scores. It has been speculated that this could be due to the higher levels of communal bonds and religious faith. In particular, all of these cultures have a heavy emphasis on community in particular which could strengthen an individual’s emotional stability throughout their growth.\n\n\nAgreeableness\nThere is more variability in the scores observed for agreeableness. The most agreeable race are the Wes Africans, Bushman and Ethiopians. Once again, this is likely tied to their sense of community developed from birth, influencing them to be more cooperative and trusting of each other. Meanwhile, the lowest agreebleness score is given to Indigenous Australians who had their land taken over by British colonists a couple centuries ago. While over time, they have been given apologies, land and certain special rights from the Australian government, that culture and past probably affected their culture, especially still living in a land that was taken from them. That could possibly explain their low agreeableness score, stemming from an antagonistic view towards the people they are living with.\n\n\nConscientiousness\nIn terms of conscientiounsness, the results are pretty evenly spread. However, the indigenous Australians do stand out as having the lowest score of 6.33. Potential causes for this score stem from a typically lower socialeconomic standard, culture and intergenerational trauma as well as rougher living environments. However, it has also been speculated that this low score could also originate due to the test being culturally biased, and thus, not providing an accurate representation of their traditions and cultural methods in which they demonstrate conscientiousness.\n\n\nIntelligence and Intellect\nIn analysing the scores for intelligence and intellect, it might be surprising to observe that the values are roughly the same across all races, with no outliers. This might seem very counter intuitive, especially given publically available academic research into differing IQ scores across races as shown in the distributions given below.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that this is a purely qualitative and not quantative test, measuring more so how intelligent an individual percieves themselves to be rather than how intelligent they actually are. As such, from this, we can conclude that your race doesn’t play a significant role in how intelligent or imaginative you percieve yourself to be.\n\n\nOverall Conclusion\nFrom the results shown below, there were definitely outliers in each of the categories to how different races answered questions on the Big 5 Personality test. While most of the results were evenly distributed, these results are enough to show that race and culture definitely have an impact in shaping an individual’s personality."
